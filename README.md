Project Abstract

Also, a lot of people feel insecure about themselves. The app provides support to these users and gives them information about the current situation and helps them in maintaining their daily habits.

Module Details:
Dashboard: The dashboard provides a controlling place in the app from where the different features can be accessed.

My Account: My Account page provides account-related details to users including their name, address, and profile picture. 

Helpline Numbers: We have provided a place where we have stored all the state emergency information as well as national emergency contact details. In case of emergency, the user has to only select the state, and emergency contacts can be dialed from the app. 

Health Reminders:  A vaccine is many months away, if not longer. In the meantime, as we return to work, itâ€™s good to know that if we are disciplined about using masks, we could keep ourselves & others safe. So, as a part of the safety app against COVID-19, we have made a feature that will enable you to set reminders for you to stay safe.

Safety Test: The test provides a relative ranking for the users by analyzing various information related to the coronavirus. The information includes current symptoms, travel history, interaction with patients, and current location. 

Settings: My Account page provides account-related details to users including their name, address, and profile picture. 

About Us: My Account page provides account-related details to users including their name, address, and profile picture. 

Choice of Technology:
Flutter 1.17.2: We have used flutter for a lot of reasons. First is, you can make native android apps using it and have the control on each pixel on the screen. It is also very handy for handling complex user gestures on the screen. But the biggest reason for using flutter is that the application is not limited to the android platform and can be easily extended to iOS and Web via the same base code.
Firebase: For handling several user information requests from authentication to data storage, we have used firebase which provides several read, write, and search queries for the different tasks for the user. 
Pub Packages: There are several pub packages we have used to provide a wide range of features to users. These are a part of flutter itself and they can be integrated with the project very easily.
Covid19India.org API: For calculating the safety rating, we require the coronavirus number data. Here the open-source API has proven its worth, as it provides daily updated statewide coronavirus number information in India.

Device Support:
Android: Although currently, the app runs on android, it can be very easily extended to iOS and Web because of flutter.

Future Expansion Plans:
The app can be further extended to iOS and Web platforms
Also, it can be implemented for people of any country by using the international COVID data API.
